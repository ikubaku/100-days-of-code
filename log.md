# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 20th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started a new (and first?)  Android App project to make a ToDo list. Did some research and learning in the process. I've set a dialog box on the button.

**Thoughts** The Dev. Environment was a little bit hard to set up on my computer. I felt the Kotlin is a pretty nice language because it deals with types carefully.
